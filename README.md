## TBD: Force Gripper Plan

### First Week

#### Theory
- Effort / motivation
- Open source grip sensor projects
- Grip strength as proxy for general health and acute state

#### Prototype

##### Physical design
1. U Shape vs Two rods (dynamometer)
2. Sensor design and placement

##### Evaluation of the design
1. Is it accurate? Repeatable? Accurate force, drifting, limitations

#### Connection to mobile app
