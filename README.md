##  Force Gripper Timeline

### First Steps

#### Theory
- Effort / motivation
- Open source grip sensor projects
- Grip strength as proxy for general health and acute state

#### Prototype

https://neurotechhub.wustl.edu/gr-pr-an-open-source-grip-strength-meter/

##### Physical design
1. U Shape 

2. Or dynamometer 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0894113024001674

3. Sensor design and placement

##### Evaluation of the design
1. Is it accurate? Repeatable? Accurate force, drifting, limitations

#### Connection to mobile app and next steps
